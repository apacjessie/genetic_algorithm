# Learning Genetic Algorithm


In my 4th year Thesis. our group propose automatic scheduling system to help our school's staff that making schedule easier without any conflict. all they need to do is add parameters like professors, room, subject. and of course the availability of the said professors and room.

In this repository, i'm trying to create a simple application of our thesis proposal "**Automatic Schedule System Application**". i'm trying to tackle this said application in easier and a not-so complex approach. By doing this. implementing the said algorithm to our main thesis will be more easier and possibly make it more complex.

Instead of doing real date of the professors and rooms availability. In this simple application. i will use Morning, Afternoon and Evening.

This application use **Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwindcss** technology for fast development.
